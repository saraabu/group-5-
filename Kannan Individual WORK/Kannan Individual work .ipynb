    "#### As directed, I am working on the 2020 COVID-19 Employment dataset so that we can assess it. The following variables are included in the data made available by the Employment excel spreadsheets: The following variables are related to the U.S.: year, Qtr, area type, state name, area ownership, industry, annual average status code, annual average establishment count, annual average employment, annual total wages, annual average weekly wage, annual average pay, employment location quotient, and total wage location quotient. Considering the multitude of factors, I have chosen to concentrate on Annual Average Employment in order to assess the most pertinent patterns. Compute the COVID-19 data trends for the final week of the available data as the first step in job 3. I've decided to analyze the state of North Carolina."
